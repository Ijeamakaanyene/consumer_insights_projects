# Economic Burden Analysis
For a potential blog post for my internship, I was tasked with exploring the relationship between environment (structural and physical) and the number of patients with acne. This is the analysis I completed, using a created economic burden index using PCA. All the patient information is fake due to it being proprietary/private - which of course affects the analysis.
