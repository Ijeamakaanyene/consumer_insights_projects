A sample of projects completed while being a consumer insights intern


# Economic Burden Analysis
For a potential blog post for my internship, I was tasked with exploring the relationship between environment (structural and physical) and the number of patients with acne. This is the analysis I completed, using a created economic burden index using PCA. All the patient information is fake due to it being proprietary/private - which of course affects the analysis.

# Dermatology Analysis 
For another potential blog post for my internship, I explored dermatologist availability across the United States. Specifically looking at availability by City, State, and per capita by city. This code is available in R and Python (in progress). The project was initially completed in R, but for fun I decided to remake the analysis in Python. 

# Value Props Experimental Design
Work completed to create an experimental design for a conjoint survey to determine what individuals liked MOST and LEAST about the products. Includes a tutorial I created for the rest of the team on how to create an experimental design.
